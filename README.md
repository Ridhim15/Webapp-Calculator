# Webapp-Calculator

Welcome to the StackCalculator project! This application is designed to perform standard arithmetic calculations efficiently using a stack-based approach. As of now, the calculator supports basic operations, but we have ambitious plans to expand its capabilities to include scientific computations, polynomial handling, currency conversions, and other specialized calculations.

## Features

- **Current Features:**
  - Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
  - User-friendly command-line interface
  - Stack-based calculation logic for efficient computation order

- **Planned Features:**
  - **Scientific Calculations:** Support for functions like sine, cosine, logarithm, exponential, etc.
  - **Polynomial Operations:** Ability to add, subtract, multiply, and evaluate polynomials.
  - **Currency Converter:** Real-time conversion between different currencies using up-to-date exchange rates.
  - **Extended Functionality:** Additional calculative features to support various professional and academic needs.
